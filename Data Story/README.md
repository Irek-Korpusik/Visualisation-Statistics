# Data Story
Data storytelling is a structured approach for communicating data insights. It involves a combination of three key elements [Brykes, 2016]: 
A)	Data
B)	Visuals
C)	narrative

Done correctly, storytelling engages the audience by appealing to both: the left (logical side) and right (intuition, emotional) parts of the brain. It also creates a deep connection with the audience, increasing attention and empathy. 

Applying your skills in R produce an analysis of a problem that will engage the reader on both the emotional and rational level.
